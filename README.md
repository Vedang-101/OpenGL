# OpenGL
Contains my tests on different rendering techniques and shader logics implemented through OpenGL

This contains projects where openGL funtionalities are tested. These features inlcude - 
- Creating windows and handle inputs
- Vertex, Fragment and Geometry Shaders codes
- Drawing 3D models
- Using 3D maths to translate, rotate and scale models and use interpolation
- Optimizations to used indexed Draws
- Different projection Mappings
- Texture Mapping
- Lighting models
- Directional, spot and point lighitng
- Importing 3rd party 3D models (supported obj and fbx non animated models)
- Shadow Mapping (from multiple Light sources)
- Cascaded shadow maps (to optimize shadow quality and memmory usage)

## Demo of the Project
The project is compiled for windows platform and contains an application file to showase all lighting models, and shadow maps along with phong lighting model. It is an interactive appliation where the player an move the camera around using WASD, mouse position and left control + space.<br/>
